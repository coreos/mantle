Standalone kola test that will test a rolling upgrade on etcd.

Note that this was pulled out from other automated kola tests because it
is not suited for automatic testing until supplying the paths of
pre-compiled binaries is no longer necessary. It is also not well-suited
for automated kola testing because it tests software versions that are
independant of the OS release process.

This must run as root!
